Learning GitHub for college projects

GitHub is one of the most widely used platforms for version control, which is a key skill for software engineering. Learning how to use GitHub will allow CSE students to keep track of changes to their code, collaborate with others, and recover from errors if necessary.

Aim to develop a series of web projects, such as a personal portfolio, a blog, or a small e-commerce site, to demonstrate your skills.
Create repositories that show off different web development frameworks or tools you're learning, like React, Next.js, or Node.js.
